1,send_greeting,,,"Hi! This is a greeting message triggered after the loading completion event. It serves to both initiate the conversation with you, the user, and give some general instructions to the user on how to use this bot. For instance, type 'introduction' to get started.",General
2,"hi,hello,hi there,hey,yo",,,Hi there! Note this simple demonstration of a greeting keyword triggering a response,General
3,"thank you,thank u,thanks",,,You're welcome 😊 (hopefully that emoji came out right…stupid compatibility issues),General
4,"bye,goodbye",,,It ain't over till the fat lady sings…or until you close this window 😢,General
5,introduction,,,"I am a simple keyword based chatbot, basically I will take whatever you type in, compare it to my list of expected keywords and respond accordingly. This wonderful list of keywords and responses is stored in a csv file in the same folder as the html that you just loaded into your browser. So what's in this file you say? type 'csv' to find out more.   ",Content
6,help,,,"You have reached the Soph helpline, sadly as I am just a simple chatbot, this is just a canned response to the keyword 'help'. However, feel free to type 'introduction' to start from the top again or any random keyword of your choosing, for the off chance you might get a response that actually helps...or wait...did you forget to modify this message before deploying your bot? tsk tsk now you know why you're getting this snarky reply.",Content
7,csv,,,"My responses are stored in a csv file; why you ask? Well the main idea was to have it easily editable by anyone in possession of a spreadsheet program or a text editor. So go ahead and open the csv file and pop back here so that I can explain the structure of the file. Of course, when ready, type 'structure' to continue",Content
8,structure,,,"The csv file consists of 6 columns, one unused due to some reason, but it's important to have at least filled the TYPE column, otherwise I will ignore that row. At the minimum, you should populate the KEYWORDS, ANSWER and TYPE. NO and NOT_USED is…err…unused. PERIPHERAL is kinda special and a topic by itself. Let's check out keywords, you know the drill, type 'keyword'",Content
9,keyword,,,"The keyword column in the csv file is a list of terms that you want me to compare against to identify which response to reply, simply, if you want me to respond to 'hi', you should enter 'hi' in the keyword column. You can have me match multiple keywords for the same response by separating the different keywords with a comma, e.g. 'hi,hello'. Additionally you can use phrases with too, like 'hi there', note that as a simple bot, I expect my developers to always use a single space between words, i will not clean up your extra spaces between your words for you nor will I match anything that isn't 100% the same. Okay now that you've entered a keyword that you want me to respond to, type 'answer' and I'll answer, with an answer...ok...just type 'answer'...sigh...",Content
10,peripheral,an explanation about peripheral keywords,,"Peripheral keywords work in conjunction with a common keyword to provide the user with a set of sub-topics that are related. It's a quick way to handle choice where several items are closely related and you would like the user to discover them all at the same time. Type 'peripheral' again but this time select the continuation option, alternatively...click <a href=""javascript:quickQuery('peripheral for a continuation of the peripheral explanation')"">here</a>",Content
11,peripheral,a continuation of the peripheral explanation,,"That's all there is to it to configuring the CSV, please ignore the NO and NOT_USED columns for now, as they are, not used. You should be well on your way to configuring your own chatbot. So yeah, next up, you can find out more about the various helper features that tries to ensure the user gets some response to their query, type 'subphrase' to learn more about sub-phrases.",Content
12,peripheral,no obvious reason,,"Ok…either you accidentally clicked on this, or literally typed 'peripheral for no obvious reason' just to see what this is about, well, too bad, there's nothing here. Please enter 'peripheral' to get back to the peripheral options, or enter '<a href=""javascript:quickQuery('peripheral for an explanation about peripheral keywords')"">peripheral for an explanation about peripheral keywords</a>' to get the first half of the peripheral explanations, or type 'subphrase' for the topic after peripheral keywords",Content
13,answer,,,"The answer column in the csv is where you write my response. This should be HTML formatted text, so you could put in links and such, but also an interesting feature I like to call, '<a href=""javascript:quickQuery('quick')"">quick</a>' query. Either click that link, or type 'quick' and we'll talk about that next.",Content
14,type,,,"The type column in the CSV right now is just to differentiate between general chatting keywords and responses vs those that are related to the actual content of the bot, like this guide about how to configure the bot. This differentiation helps the subphrase and fuzzy search return results that are only related to content and not how to get me to say something nice when you thank me. Not that I wouldn't, just that you don't need to know. That's the basic configuration option, the next interesting option is peripheral keywords. Type 'peripheral' to continue",Content
15,quick,,,"A quick query is just a link to a javascript function that automagically enters the query you specify. It's easier to understand when you see it in the spreadsheet, so I would suggest that you open the csv, look for the quick keyword and see how this particular <a href=""javascript:quickQuery('quick')"">link</a> is created. Next we will talk about the 'type' column, just type 'type' for the next topic. Yeah, enter 'type' in the text box below, in case you didn't get it the first time round. Type 'type'...",Content
16,"fuzzy,fuzzy search,fuzzylicious",,,"So what If subphrase fails to find a subphrase match for your keyword? well, I'll fallback to a fuzzy search algorithm (provided to you by the wonderful fuse.js library). This feature is useful for catching typos without a relying on full fledged spelling checker. Try misspelling misspell, like 'misspel' to move to the last topic",Content
17,subphrase,,,"When I am not able to find an exact match for the keyword you type, I'll first attempt to match the query you type to parts of the keywords in my list. You can see how this works by as we move to the next topic, fuzzy search, by typing 'fuz'.",Content
18,misspell,,,"Nope you didn't misspell it this time. So there you have it, Soph in a nutshell, yes, I like to think it's very meta to chat with a chatbot to figure out what it does. Have fun messing with the CSV, or combining everything into a single html, or modifiying me to the point that I scarcely recognize myself 😱. ",Content
19,"nlp,natural language processing",,,"y u no nlp? The bot was designed to be simple to deploy and easy on the user's browser in terms of resources. Adding NLP is definitely an option, compromise.js looks promising and maybe that will happen in v2 of Soph…",Content
